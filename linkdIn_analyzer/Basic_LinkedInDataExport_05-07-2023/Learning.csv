Python: Working with Predictive Analytics,"Data can tell many stories: where it came from <i>and</i> where it’s going. Predictive analytics gives programmers a tool to tell stories about the future: to extract usable information and make accurate predictions. These predictions, in turn, allow business to make more informed, impactful decisions. Join Isil Berkun, data scientist, to explore predictive analytics with Python. Discover how to prepare data—fill in missing values, perform feature scaling, and more—and use prebuilt Python libraries to make and evaluate prediction models. She describes what models to use when, and explains the concepts in such a way that you can immediately apply them to your own work. By the end of the course, you’ll be able to leverage Python libraries like pandas and NumPy and choose the right prediction models for your projects.",Course,2022-01-27 17:06 UTC,N/A,false,N/A,
